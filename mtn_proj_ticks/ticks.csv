2nd go: ground to b4, take, 4-13, fell, hung for less than a minute, pulled back on, then went to the top.
3rd go started cramping :(

Beta improvements:
Rest at b2 there is a RH side-pull crimp to switch it up.
I Do actually briefly use the kneebar at b10, but not for very long. 
At b11, setting up for the LH undercling, there’s a slightly higher right foot, to get established in the undercling. Then for the undercling move, it’s easier to hike the right foot higher to the flat shelf.
At b13, RH to the sloper, then instead of bumping RH to the crystal, bump it to the slot instead. Then LH to the crystal.
At the last rest above b17, there’s a small RH crimp side pull",https://www.mountainproject.com/route/114534087/super-tuscan,1,"Colorado > Boulder > Flatirons > South > Seal Rock",3.8,4,Lead,Fell/Hung,Sport,,110,8900

Use Adam’s beta at b13: RH on the higher good side pull, left hand to the sloper, right foot up and in, then go to the tick in the dish.
